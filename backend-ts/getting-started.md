## Pre-installation
1. Make sure you have Node installed by using the command `node -v`. The minimum node version compatible with this
lib is 13.2. If Node is not installed or is on an unsupported version, consider installing nvm in your machine. nvm is
a tool to manage node versions installed in the system, it's easier to upgrade and switch from one version to another
than a pure installation of node. To install nvm, check [this link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). If you don't want
to install nvm, you can also download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. This is optional, but we recommend using yarn instead of npm. If you choose to follow this recommendation, use the
command `npm install yarn --global`.

## Installation
In order to make it easier and faster to start up a project with Nimbus Backend TS, you should install our CLI tool
globally:

```shell
yarn global add @zup-it/nimbus-backend-cli
```

## Creating a new project
Using the CLI, run the command `new` with the name of your project:
```shell
nimbus-ts new [PROJECT NAME]
```

This command will create the following project structure:
```asc
ðŸ“¦ project-name
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ screens
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ home.tsx  // example of navigation between screens
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ index.ts  // file where the routes are defined
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ welcome.tsx  // example for default page
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ config.ts  // file that have methods to get the NimbusTsConfig
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ global-context.ts  // declaration of GlobalContext and example for its usage
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ index.ts  // root of the express app, where everything is set up
 â”£ ðŸ“œ .editorconfig
 â”£ ðŸ“œ .eslintrc.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œ LICENSE
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
 â”£ ðŸ“œ nimbus-ts.json  // configuration file to be used by the CLI and the Express App  
 â”£ ðŸ“œ package-lock.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œ package.json
 â”— ðŸ“œ tsconfig.json
```

## Running the application:
```shell
cd [PROJECT NAME]
yarn start
```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000` if you didn't change any of the default configurations.
This command also starts a websocket server that enables hot-reloading in frontend applications. To know more
about this, read this [topic](cli.md#starting-up-the-server-and-hot-reloading).

## Full documentation for the CLI
Read the topic [topic](cli.md) to know more about every command and options of the CLI.
